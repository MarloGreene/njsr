text tool: feel free to get creative with a name
Couple rows up top, some menu / filter / search stuff
Row of pseudo file icons for our current / default provided texts: bom.txt, hamlet.txt, etc.
Option for user to drag their own text file onto the file row, thereby uploading it to memory / localStorage, such that they can then search, highlight, note, and export their own provided texts?
Statistics options for word clouds / frequency, charting, graphing, stats, random verse / quote, etc.

Search results, full text, etc. etc. etc. below.

Use case: I go to njsr.org/text and am greeted by a sleek and minimalist page, inviting me to type something in the search bar or click one of the stat button options to explore texts, either individually or together.

I select Bible and Book of Mormon and search for "Jesus," showing me results from each volume, with options to expand from there to the surrounding text ("jump to full text" kind of thing), take a note, highlight, pin, star, add to list, rate? (I'm way over-thinking it.)

Then I go back to the file row on top and de-select the Book of Mormon and select Shakespeare or the Odyssey or another of our defaults to do the same searching and notating.

Then I'm like hey, I have my own collection of huge text files I'd like to search and highlight and etc.; I'm gonna drag my very own .txt or .md or other plain text only file to explore onto the file area on the page, and it'll process the file into localStorage / memory, so nothing actually touches our server, but they're able to maintain their own session files to a reasonable degree.

Inspired by all of our other text and search pages.

Big ask, but I believe in you!

I've included a few files in ./txt/ for initial inclusion.
