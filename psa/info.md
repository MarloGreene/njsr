PTSD Slider
Site contains a slider on top graded at 0, 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100%
Below the slider is a grid of symptoms and checkboxes, defaulted to no boxes checked
As the slider increases, relevant boxes start getting checked.

This may sound a bit esoteric so far, but what I'm getting at is this, from an end-user-use-case scenario:
I send an old battle buddy to the page, because even though he served next to me for two combat deployments in Iraq, he considers his service "I did my four and got out," and he never even formed a relationship with the VA. It has proven exhausting work on my end to hold dudes' hands to 100%, so now I'm content just making sure everybody has SOME relationship with the VA, even if it's just a stubborn 10% for hearing loss.

So at any rate, as you drag this slider from 0 to 100%, and the symptoms start lighting up, maybe they'll be like "Oh well yeah, I do have hearing loss. And a short temper. And relationship problems. And anger outbursts. And trouble keeping a job. And ..."

The finer description eludes me, but I hope this will give you inspiration and an idea of where I'm trying to go with it. Because I'd venture to guess if you told most of my battle buddies to stop dragging when you stop recognizing symptoms, they'd all end up around 100%.

But at any rate, let's start from there, and if possible, go ahead and throw in some estimated compensation amounts from the VA for various ratings. We're using primarily the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) (https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/adult-int/caps.asp) for our symptom criteria.)
