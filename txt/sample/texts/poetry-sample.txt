In ancient times, when words held sway,
And poets sang of night and day,
The muses whispered soft and low,
Of truths that only hearts could know.

Through verdant fields and mountains high,
Beneath the ever-changing sky,
We wander seeking what is true,
The light that guides us, ever new.

O gentle reader, pause and think,
How life hangs by the slender link,
Of moments passing, swift and fleet,
Where joy and sorrow often meet.

The stars above keep silent watch,
While time unfolds without a notch,
Each second precious, never twice,
A pearl beyond all mortal price.

So take these words and hold them dear,
Through seasons turning, year by year,
For in the verse, a truth resides,
That in the heart forever bides.
