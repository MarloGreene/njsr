Photo grid portfolio site. Minimalist page of photo thumbnails, zoom in or out to view more or fewer thumbnails, tap / click to view full window, tap/swipe left/right to navigate, swipe down to close ... OK I think I'm essentially describing replicating my iPhone's photos app, which is pretty accurate. I'd like to share my portfolio, and I'll periodically add photos to subfolder img/ and maybe a quick and easy node script can ensure all images are on the page. Suggestions for setup? html/css/js for our core setup, please.
