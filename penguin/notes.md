a retro-style 3-d runner, and it's from the bottom up view, if that makes sense (standard third person view), and there's a tremendous mountain far in the background. Arrow keys do what you'd expect, spacebar to jump (also wasd, f to jump ... maybe vimkeys and spacebar, also?), a subtle transparent overlay in the bottom right corner telling us our keyboard shortcuts, becomes more visible on mouse hover. the penguin as we run forward and jukes left or right or jumps, gets very slowly closer to the mountain, and if we get to where we can actually crest the peak of that mountain, we will discover only another peak beyond. there is always another mountain to climb. Sisyphus, but fun. jumping also lets you slide faster on your belly for a bit before you run again to pick up speed.
