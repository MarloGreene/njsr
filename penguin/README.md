# Penguin Peak

A retro-style 3D endless runner about a penguin climbing mountains that never end.

*"The mountain never ends. Neither do you."*

## Gameplay

Run endlessly toward a distant mountain peak. When you finally reach it, another peak awaits beyond. This is Sisyphus, but with flippers and a positive attitude.

- **Dodge obstacles**: Ice blocks, crevasses, and the occasional snowman
- **Jump and slide**: Jumping triggers a belly slide that boosts your speed
- **Chase peaks**: Track how many mountains you've "conquered"

## Controls

| Action | Keys |
|--------|------|
| Move left | `A` / `H` / `←` |
| Move right | `D` / `L` / `→` |
| Jump & slide | `Space` / `F` |

A subtle controls overlay appears in the bottom-right corner.

## Features

- Pseudo-3D perspective rendering with canvas
- Dynamic aurora borealis and twinkling stars
- Animated penguin with waddle and belly-slide states
- Progressive mountain approach with peak transitions
- High score persistence via localStorage
- Retro scanline overlay effect

## Philosophy

There is always another mountain to climb. The game doesn't end when you reach the peak—it reveals more horizon. Progress is measured not in victories but in the journey itself.
