                    <h3>Threat Calibration</h3>
                    <p>Your amygdala &mdash; the brain's threat detection center &mdash; learned to stay hot. In theater, that kept you alive. Back home, it reads everything as potential contact.</p>
                    <p>A slamming door. A crowded room. Your wife approaching from behind.</p>
                    <p>The alarm never got the stand-down order.</p>

                    <h3>Cortisol Overload</h3>
                    <p>Stress hormones that were designed for short bursts ran continuously for months. Maybe years. Your system adapted to operating in emergency mode.</p>
                    <p>Now "normal" feels wrong. Quiet feels suspicious.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Sleep Disruption</h3>
                    <p>Your brain learned that deep sleep is dangerous. Unconscious means vulnerable. So it keeps you in light sleep, ready to react.</p>
                    <p>The exhaustion is real. It's not laziness. It's survival programming that hasn't updated.</p>

                    <h3>Hypervigilance</h3>
                    <p>Scanning every room. Sitting with your back to the wall. Tracking exits. Watching hands.</p>
                    <p>This isn't paranoia. This is a nervous system doing exactly what it was trained to do &mdash; in an environment where that training no longer applies.</p>

                    <p>When the volume of combat is too high, the brain turns down all volume. Joy, connection, love &mdash; they get muted along with the pain.</p>
                    <p>You're not cold. You're protected. The system is doing its job too well.</p>
