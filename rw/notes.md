RunWritr

A minimalist writing environment (maybe look at or duplicate ../zenw/ for inspiration or foundation) that adds a little top-row flair.
All the animation is individual ascii characters (maybe unicode for ultimate fancy mode toggle, like a rich text or plain text mode, I'm over-thinking it)
Animation space takes up the top few rows of the page.
As we write in our focused text box, the ascii guy on top starts walking / running, depending on how fast we're typing, maybe falls down if we backspace or make an obvious typo, maybe does a jump animation at the end of a sentence, jumps over a chasm or does something otherwise impressive as we Return -> Return to start a new paragraph ...
If we're idle and not writing, maybe an idle animation for our runner?
I don't know what the runner's goal is, other than to just be a fun little visual motivator as we keep our fingers typing.
What do you think?
If you think it has legs, let's do it!
