## Suggestions for Improvement

- **Advanced Search Features**: Implement fuzzy search, regex support, and search within specific documents or categories to make finding content more flexible and powerful.
- **Document Organization**: Add categorization, tagging, or folders for documents to help users navigate and filter by topic (e.g., legal, religious, philosophical).
- **Export and Sharing**: Allow users to export highlighted or pinned results as PDF, print-friendly versions, or share direct links to specific verses/sentences.
- **User Experience Enhancements**: Introduce dark mode, keyboard shortcuts for navigation, and improved mobile responsiveness for better accessibility on all devices.
- **Persistence and Sync**: Beyond localStorage, consider adding cloud sync or account-based saving for bookmarks and highlights across devices.
- **Performance Optimizations**: For large documents, implement lazy loading, indexing, or pagination to ensure fast search even with extensive text collections.
- **Accessibility**: Add screen reader support, high contrast modes, and keyboard-only navigation to make the page usable for everyone.
- **Additional Features**: Include a reading mode for distraction-free viewing, note-taking capabilities, and integration with external tools like citation managers.
- **Analytics and Feedback**: Track popular searches or documents to suggest improvements, and add a feedback form for user input.
- **Offline Support**: Enable service workers for offline access to cached documents and searches.
