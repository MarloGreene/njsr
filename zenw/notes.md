Zen Writer: zero distractions, full-screen focus on writing.
https://www.calmlywriter.com/online/ interesting inspiration, but you know I love dark mode.

All data stays in browser, export any time, import ...

Page loads directly into a text field to start writing immediately, low-profile button options for import / export, maybe light or dark theme, font selection and size ... I'm good with many options, but they've got to be very cleanly and minimally implemented.

tech stack: .html, .css, .js, localStorage
